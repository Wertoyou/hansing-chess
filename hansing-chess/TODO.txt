Improvments
-Pregen move results for more possibilities with gui integration,
    -maybe use flexible Option<Board> in MoveData to ALLOW for pregen without DEMANDING it.
-Build system for prompting promotions
-Refractor Castleing
-Refractor Threats
-Consider if there is a better way to do movegen/board file split
-Standardized function for getting relevant data from board.pieces
    -maybe integrate with replacemnet for Occupancy
-Rework module structure (more folders)
-More/better fmt implementations
-Look over names and naming convension

Features
-Load from file (use chess standard like PGN?)
-History and undo
-Smart annotations as input (and MoveData fmt?) for better terminal interface
